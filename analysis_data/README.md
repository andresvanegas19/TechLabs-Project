# Data analysis

## Introduction
The following section is dedicated to analyzing and predicting health trends in times 
of quarantine, more focused on the people who need it. The section is divided into two 
sections where, in the first section with dataset of https://www.data.gov/ you will see
if there is a need to provide support to people who are in trouble at the moment 
so difficult. Then there is the implementation with web scraping and using the most famous and used 
api of facebook to collect user data and give an end result of their tastes.
Finally it will show how it works with data provided by the social network Facebook,
This will use the api and web scraping to obtain the categories of the page.

### DATA
To start, I'll show you some important facts that show how many people are affected by health
mental. This data is very important because we will see if this is the importance of the use of
an application to solve this problem.

### APLICACION
With the above graphics you can dimension that if there is a need for an application
to be able to help people who need support in mental health issues. Then you can 
that you are aware of the need for support for these people; the application will be used.
One of the tools that the application will have is in the subject of data analysis that will be done 
through the facebook api. This will collect all the important data about the tastes of the
people and will be classified among the most important, as shown in the following graph
We've already seen the graphics and each one means, how would all this apply to your best
use.

As you can see in the image the higher results means that it will be your taste and it will be used
and then show content that helps the person improve their mental health.
To see the step by step of how the data was obtained, you can see in the 
**mining_data_facebook** and see how the data was obtained.

The following implementation is to verify if these data are true. With this, a sample is taken
of the web pages that the person follows and then in this one, with web scraping is obtained in the category in
than this one. As shown in the image below.

### FINALIDAD
With the first data we observe, it is already clear that there is a need for a
helps people who are suffering and need help, then it is with the help of the networks
social we can look at the tastes and see what the person might like in the future.
Finally we will get a recommendation to this person hoping that there will be improvements.
