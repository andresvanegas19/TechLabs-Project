## News Classification
Using [`Natural Language Toolkit`](http://www.nltk.org/), based on the information provided by the initial survey and Facebook scraping (optional), Mood Booster will import news/articles headlines to classify as good, neutral and bad, according to the classification these will be feed to the users during the day.

Project-How to stay mentally healthy in quarantine?

Basic idea: Build a website application where the users interact with a survey in which they are asked basic questions on how is their day going (related to their mood). Survey answers will be analysed and the app will return content based on the mood of the user:

1. Bad mood: app will return positive/uplifting content including good news, positive activities, easy delicious recipes, happy playlists, heartwarming stories,  etc.
2. Good mood: App will return, news of all sorts (good, bad neutral), challenging recipes, exercises, all around content.
The idea is that, in this situation, we have good days and lazy/down days. A lazy/down day, for example, you want to detach from the depressing news and the complicated stuff. Generally, these lazy days are accompanied or triggered by some lame/bad mood, this is where the app acts as a "blocker" of unwanted content and throws at you some good/happy/uplifting material so you get through those inevitable days surrounded with positive information/activities.

Stuff we need right now:
1. Polish the idea (it's still in a raw form). Figure out what will be possible in this challenge.
2. Divide our tasks. Discuss what each team member can contribute to the project with the knowledge from the courses.
